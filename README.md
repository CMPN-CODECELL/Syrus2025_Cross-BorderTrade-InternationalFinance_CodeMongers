# Syrus2025_Cross-BorderTrade-InternationalFinance_CodeMongers
After the feedback and mentoring round, we implemented PII masking in the Invoice Agent to safeguard personal data and enhance security, as recommended by our mentors. Additionally, we developed a RAG container containing data related to HS codes, product details, and product categories, integrating it into the Invoice Agent for improved analysis of HS codes and product classifications. Furthermore, we initiated the development of two new agents: the Supplier Agent and the Compliance Check Agent.
